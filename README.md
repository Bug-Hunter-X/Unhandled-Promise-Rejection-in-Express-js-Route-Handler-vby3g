This repository demonstrates a common Node.js error: unhandled promise rejections in Express.js route handlers. The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version using proper error handling.  The bug arises from an asynchronous operation that may fail without proper error handling, leading to a crash or unexpected behavior.  The solution demonstrates best practices for preventing this issue.
